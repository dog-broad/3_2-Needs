# What is Git and why is it used?

**Git** is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and manage code bases efficiently. It records changes to files over time, enabling developers to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and work concurrently on different branches of code. Git is widely used in software development to ensure version control, facilitate collaboration, and maintain code integrity.




# Distinguish between Git and GitHub:

| Aspect                               | Git                                             | GitHub                                                |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                       | Git is software that tracks changes to files and manages code versions on a computer. | GitHub is a website where developers store and share their Git repositories online. |
| **Primary Use**                      | Git is used for version control, allowing developers to track changes and collaborate on code locally. | GitHub is used to host Git repositories online, enabling collaboration and sharing among developers. |
| **Access**                           | Git works locally on a computer and does not need an internet connection for basic operations like saving changes. | GitHub requires an internet connection as it's a web-based service where repositories are stored remotely. |
| **Collaboration**                    | Collaboration in Git happens through direct access or sharing repositories among team members or peers. | GitHub enhances collaboration with features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project management tools. |
| **Repository Hosting**               | Git itself does not provide hosting services; repositories are stored on local or remote servers independent of Git. | GitHub hosts Git repositories on its servers, providing a centralized platform for managing and sharing code. |
| **Visibility**                       | Git repositories can be private (accessible only to specific users) or public (open to everyone) based on where they are hosted. | GitHub repositories can be public (visible to anyone) or private (restricted to authorized users), depending on settings. |
| **Graphical Interface**              | Git is primarily used via a command line interface (CLI), though there are GUI tools like GitKraken and SourceTree. | GitHub offers a web-based graphical interface where users can perform Git operations like committing changes through their browser. |
| **Backup and Redundancy**            | Git relies on manual backups or additional tools for redundancy since repositories are typically stored in one location. | GitHub provides built-in redundancy and backup services for repositories hosted on its servers, reducing data loss risks. |
| **Integration with CI/CD**           | Git itself does not integrate with CI/CD pipelines directly; integration is handled by external tools and scripts. | GitHub integrates seamlessly with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, enabling automated testing and deployment workflows from repositories. |
| **Issue Tracking**                   | Git lacks built-in issue tracking; issues are managed manually or through external tools. | GitHub includes robust issue tracking features within repositories, allowing users to create, assign, and discuss issues. |
| **Community and Networking**         | Git does not have features for discovering or networking with other developers outside of direct collaboration. | GitHub fosters community interaction with features like following users, starring repositories, and contributing to open-source projects. |
| **Security and Permissions**         | Git relies on file system permissions for security, varying based on where repositories are hosted (local or remote server). | GitHub provides fine-grained access controls, allowing repository owners to manage permissions for collaborators and teams with different levels of access. |
| **Pricing**                          | Git is free and open-source, available for installation on any compatible operating system. | GitHub offers free and paid plans, with additional features like private repositories and advanced security available in paid tiers. |




# Steps to create a new Git local Repository and remote repository:

### Creating a new Git local repository:

1. **Initialize Git Repository**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Git repository.
   ```
   cd /path/to/your/directory
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Files**:
   Create new files or copy existing files into this directory.
   ```
   touch README.md
   ```

3. **Stage Files**:
   Add the files to the staging area to prepare them for commit.
   ```
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**:
   Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

### Creating a new remote repository (assuming GitHub):

5. **Create Remote Repository on GitHub**:
   - Log in to your GitHub account.
   - Click on the "+" sign in the upper-right corner and select "New repository".
   - Enter a repository name, choose public or private, and optionally initialize with a README file.
   - Click on "Create repository".

6. **Link Local Repository to Remote Repository**:
   - Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL of your newly created GitHub repository.

7. **Add Remote Repository**:
   ```
   git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
   ```

8. **Push to Remote Repository**:
   Push your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```



# Examine git add, status, log, commit, push, branch, merge commands:

1. **git add**: Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area for the next commit.
   
2. **git status**: Shows the current status of the working directory and staging area. It lists which files are modified, staged, or untracked.

3. **git log**: Displays the commit history of the repository, showing details like commit hashes, authors, dates, and commit messages.

4. **git commit**: Records changes staged in the index (staging area) to the repository's history, creating a new commit with a commit message.

5. **git push**: Transfers local repository commits to a remote repository, typically to GitHub or another hosting service.

6. **git branch**: Lists, creates, or deletes branches. It allows you to work on different parts of the repository simultaneously.

7. **git merge**: Integrates changes from one branch into another. It combines changes made on two branches and creates a new commit.



# How to deploy your website on Heroku using GitHub or Git:

Deploying a website on Heroku using Git involves the following steps:

1. **Prepare your Application**: Ensure your web application is ready and committed to a Git repository locally.

2. **Create a Heroku Account**: Sign up for a Heroku account if you haven't already.

3. **Install Heroku CLI**: Download and install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage your applications.

4. **Login to Heroku CLI**: Log in to your Heroku account using the command `heroku login`.

5. **Create a Heroku App**: Create a new Heroku app using `heroku create`. This initializes a new Git remote named `heroku`.

6. **Deploy Your Code**: Push your code to Heroku using `git push heroku main` (replace `main` with your branch name if different). This deploys your application to Heroku.

7. **Open Your App**: After deployment, you can open your app in the browser using `heroku open`.
