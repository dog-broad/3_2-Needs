# Installation of Node.js and npm:

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code server-side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, developed by Google for use in Chrome, to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js, used for installing, managing, and sharing reusable JavaScript packages and libraries.

**Installation Process:**
To install Node.js and npm on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).
   - Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Download the installer package (.msi for Windows, .pkg for macOS, or .tar.gz for Linux).

2. **Install Node.js:**
   - Run the downloaded installer package and follow the installation instructions.
   - Accept the license agreement and choose the installation directory.
   - Complete the installation process.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `node -v` and press Enter to check the installed Node.js version.
   - Type `npm -v` and press Enter to check the installed npm version.
   - If both commands return version numbers, Node.js and npm are installed successfully.

**Features of Node.js:**
- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven:** Node.js uses non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it highly efficient and suitable for building scalable, real-time applications.
- **JavaScript Everywhere:** Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript on both the client and server sides, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.
- **Vast Ecosystem:** npm provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source packages and libraries, allowing developers to leverage existing solutions for various functionalities.
- **High Performance:** Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript code to native machine code, resulting in high performance and low latency.
- **Single Threaded, Event Loop:** Node.js employs a single-threaded event loop model, enabling handling of multiple concurrent connections efficiently without the overhead of thread management.

# Built-in Modules in Node.js

Built-in modules in Node.js are pre-installed libraries that provide essential functionality for Node.js applications. They are built-in to the Node.js runtime environment and can be used directly without installation. Some of the commonly used built-in modules include:

- **fs:** This module provides a set of functions for interacting with the file system.
- **path:** This module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
- **os:** This module provides a set of functions for interacting with the operating system.
- **http:** This module provides a set of functions for creating and interacting with HTTP requests and responses.
- **url:** This module provides a set of functions for parsing and manipulating URLs.

To interact with the built-in modules, you can use the `require()` function, which is a built-in Node.js function that allows you to import a module and access its exported functions. For example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const os = require('os');
const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');
```

Let us take an example of using the `fs` module to read a file:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});

```

- The above code will read a file named `file.txt` from the current directory and print its contents to the console. 
- The `fs.readFile()` function reads the contents of the file asynchronously and calls the callback function with the data once the operation is complete.


# Template Engines in Node.js

Template engines in Node.js are used to generate dynamic HTML content by combining HTML markup with data from a server-side source. They simplify the process of generating HTML pages dynamically by allowing developers to write templates with placeholders for dynamic content.

**Popular Template Engines:**
1. **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** EJS allows embedding JavaScript code directly within HTML markup, making it easy to generate dynamic content. It supports control structures like loops and conditionals.
   
2. **Pug (formerly Jade):** Pug is a high-performance template engine with a concise and expressive syntax. It uses indentation and whitespace to define the structure of the HTML document, reducing the amount of boilerplate code.

3. **Handlebars:** Handlebars is a logic-less template engine that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. It supports partials, helpers, and data binding, making it suitable for building modular and maintainable templates.

4. **Mustache:** Mustache is a minimalistic template system with support for various programming languages, including JavaScript. It follows the principle of "logic-less" templates, focusing on simplicity and portability.

Examples for each template engine in Node.js:

### 1. EJS (Embedded JavaScript)

#### Example:
Install EJS:
```bash
npm install ejs
```

Create a simple EJS template (`views/example.ejs`):
```html
<!-- views/example.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>EJS Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, <%= name %></h1>
    <p>This is a simple EJS example.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Using EJS in Node.js (`server.js`):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Set EJS as the view engine
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// Render the EJS template
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('example', { name: 'John' });
});

// Start server
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### 2. Pug (formerly Jade)

#### Example:
Install Pug:
```bash
npm install pug
```

Create a simple Pug template (`views/example.pug`):
```pug
// views/example.pug
doctype html
html(lang="en")
  head
    meta(charset="UTF-8")
    meta(name="viewport", content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0")
    title Pug Example
  body
    h1 Hello, #{name}
    p This is a simple Pug example.
```

Using Pug in Node.js (`server.js`):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Set Pug as the view engine
app.set('view engine', 'pug');

// Render the Pug template
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('example', { name: 'Jane' });
});

// Start server
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### 3. Handlebars

#### Example:
Install Handlebars:
```bash
npm install express-handlebars
```

Create a simple Handlebars template (`views/example.handlebars`):
```handlebars
<!-- views/example.handlebars -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Handlebars Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, {{name}}</h1>
    <p>This is a simple Handlebars example.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Using Handlebars in Node.js (`server.js`):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const exphbs  = require('express-handlebars');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Set Handlebars as the view engine
app.engine('.hbs', exphbs({ extname: '.hbs' }));
app.set('view engine', '.hbs');

// Render the Handlebars template
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('example', { name: 'Jake' });
});

// Start server
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### 4. Mustache

#### Example:
Install Mustache:
```bash
npm install mustache
```

Create a simple Mustache template (`views/example.mustache`):
```html
<!-- views/example.mustache -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Mustache Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, {{name}}</h1>
    <p>This is a simple Mustache example.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Using Mustache in Node.js (`server.js`):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const mustacheExpress = require('mustache-express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Register '.mustache' extension with the Mustache template engine
app.engine('mustache', mustacheExpress());
app.set('view engine', 'mustache');

// Render the Mustache template
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('example', { name: 'Mary' });
});

// Start server
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

# Creating a Simple Server (Express)

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, known for its simplicity, flexibility, and robust features. It provides a minimalist and unopinionated structure for building web servers and APIs.

**Process to Create a Simple Server with Express**

1. **Install Express:**
   - Install Express using npm by running `npm install express` in your project directory.

2. **Create a Server File:**
   - Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `server.js`) in your project directory.

3. **Import Express:**
   - Import the Express module in your server file using `require()`.

4. **Create an Express App:**
   - Initialize an Express application by calling `express()`.

5. **Define Routes:**
   - Define routes for handling HTTP requests using methods like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, etc.

6. **Start the Server:**
   - Bind and listen to a port using the `app.listen()` method, specifying the port number and an optional callback function.

**Example:**
```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define a route for handling GET requests
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server on port 3000
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

7. **Run the Server:**
   - Execute the server file using Node.js by running `node server.js` in the terminal.
   - Access the server in a web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

Express.js simplifies the process of creating web servers in Node.js by providing a robust set of features, middleware, and conventions for handling HTTP requests and building RESTful APIs.


# SQL Databases vs. MongoDB

| Feature/Aspect                      | SQL Databases                                     | MongoDB                                                |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Storage                        | Uses tables with predefined schema and relations  | Stores data in flexible, schema-less documents (JSON)   |
| Schema                               | Requires a predefined schema with tables and columns | Schema is dynamic; documents can have varying structures |
| Query Language                      | Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying | Uses a rich query language similar to JavaScript       |
| Data Structure                      | Organized in tables with rows and columns         | Stores data in collections of JSON-like documents       |
| Joins                                | Supports complex joins across tables              | No joins in traditional sense; supports aggregation framework |
| Scalability                         | Vertical scaling is common (adding more resources to a single server) | Horizontal scaling is typical (adding more servers to distribute load) |
| Performance                         | Well-suited for complex queries and transactions  | High performance for large volumes of data and high throughput |
| Flexibility                         | Less flexible due to rigid schema requirements   | Highly flexible; documents can evolve over time         |
| Transactions                        | ACID transactions supported for data integrity   | Transactions are supported, but with some limitations   |
| Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID) | Ensures all transactions are processed reliably | Provides flexibility in ACID properties depending on configuration |
| Use Cases                           | Best for structured data and complex queries     | Ideal for applications with constantly changing data    |
| Development Complexity              | Often requires careful planning of schema design | Easier to develop and adapt due to schema-less nature   |


# Middleware of Node MongoDB Driver

### What is Middleware?

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions can perform various tasks, such as:

*   Executing code
*   Modifying the request and response objects
*   Ending the request-response cycle
*   Calling the next middleware function


**Middleware in the Node MongoDB Driver:**

Middleware in the context of the Node MongoDB driver is not as explicitly defined as in frameworks like Express. However, middleware functionality can be achieved using Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose allows you to define middleware functions that can run during various stages of database operations, such as before saving a document or after retrieving it.

**Types of Middleware in Mongoose:**

1. **Pre Middleware:** Runs before certain operations like `save`, `validate`, `remove`, etc.
2. **Post Middleware:** Runs after certain operations like `init`, `validate`, `save`, `remove`, etc.

**Example:**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: String,
  password: String,
});

// Pre-save middleware to hash the password before saving it
userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  // Hash the password (using bcrypt for example)
  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) return next(err);
    user.password = hash;
    next();
  });
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```
