# Installation of Node.js and npm:

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code server-side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, developed by Google for use in Chrome, to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js, used for installing, managing, and sharing reusable JavaScript packages and libraries.

**Installation Process:**
To install Node.js and npm on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).
   - Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Download the installer package (.msi for Windows, .pkg for macOS, or .tar.gz for Linux).

2. **Install Node.js:**
   - Run the downloaded installer package and follow the installation instructions.
   - Accept the license agreement and choose the installation directory.
   - Complete the installation process.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `node -v` and press Enter to check the installed Node.js version.
   - Type `npm -v` and press Enter to check the installed npm version.
   - If both commands return version numbers, Node.js and npm are installed successfully.

**Features of Node.js:**
- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven:** Node.js uses non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it highly efficient and suitable for building scalable, real-time applications.
- **JavaScript Everywhere:** Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript on both the client and server sides, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.
- **Vast Ecosystem:** npm provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source packages and libraries, allowing developers to leverage existing solutions for various functionalities.
- **High Performance:** Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript code to native machine code, resulting in high performance and low latency.
- **Single Threaded, Event Loop:** Node.js employs a single-threaded event loop model, enabling handling of multiple concurrent connections efficiently without the overhead of thread management.

# Template Engines in Node.js

Template engines in Node.js are used to generate dynamic HTML content by combining HTML markup with data from a server-side source. They simplify the process of generating HTML pages dynamically by allowing developers to write templates with placeholders for dynamic content.

**Popular Template Engines:**
1. **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** EJS allows embedding JavaScript code directly within HTML markup, making it easy to generate dynamic content. It supports control structures like loops and conditionals.
   
2. **Pug (formerly Jade):** Pug is a high-performance template engine with a concise and expressive syntax. It uses indentation and whitespace to define the structure of the HTML document, reducing the amount of boilerplate code.

3. **Handlebars:** Handlebars is a logic-less template engine that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. It supports partials, helpers, and data binding, making it suitable for building modular and maintainable templates.

4. **Mustache:** Mustache is a minimalistic template system with support for various programming languages, including JavaScript. It follows the principle of "logic-less" templates, focusing on simplicity and portability.

# Creating a Simple Server (Express)

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, known for its simplicity, flexibility, and robust features. It provides a minimalist and unopinionated structure for building web servers and APIs.

**Process to Create a Simple Server with Express**

1. **Install Express:**
   - Install Express using npm by running `npm install express` in your project directory.

2. **Create a Server File:**
   - Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `server.js`) in your project directory.

3. **Import Express:**
   - Import the Express module in your server file using `require()`.

4. **Create an Express App:**
   - Initialize an Express application by calling `express()`.

5. **Define Routes:**
   - Define routes for handling HTTP requests using methods like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, etc.

6. **Start the Server:**
   - Bind and listen to a port using the `app.listen()` method, specifying the port number and an optional callback function.

**Example:**
```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define a route for handling GET requests
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server on port 3000
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

7. **Run the Server:**
   - Execute the server file using Node.js by running `node server.js` in the terminal.
   - Access the server in a web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

Express.js simplifies the process of creating web servers in Node.js by providing a robust set of features, middleware, and conventions for handling HTTP requests and building RESTful APIs.
