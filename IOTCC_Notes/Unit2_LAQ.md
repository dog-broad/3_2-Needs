# 4 Pillars of IoT

1. **M2M (Machine-to-Machine)**: Uses devices like in-vehicle gadgets to capture events, such as engine issues, and sends this data over cellular or other networks to a central server. The server interprets these events to provide actionable alerts for maintenance.

2. **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)**: Uses radio waves to transfer data from electronic tags on objects to a central system via a reader. This technology identifies and tracks objects efficiently.

3. **WSN (Wireless Sensor Network)**: Consists of autonomous sensors spread out to monitor physical or environmental conditions like temperature or motion. These sensors communicate data through short-range wireless mesh networks (and sometimes wired or hybrid networks) to a central location.

4. **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)**: A system that connects, monitors, and controls equipment in facilities such as plants or buildings. It uses wired networks (often short-range field buses) or sometimes wireless or hybrid networks, applying closed-loop control or smart system principles.
