# Framework of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are a key component of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, enabling the collection and transmission of data from distributed sensors to a central location. The framework of WSN involves various layers and components that work together to ensure efficient data communication and processing. Here's an overview of the key elements of the WSN framework:

### 1. OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)

**What is it?**
OGC SWE(Open Geospatial Consortium, Sensor Web Enablement) is a set of standards that make it easier to use sensors over the internet. It aims to connect various sensors (like weather monitors or pollution detectors) and their data so that they can be easily found, accessed, and controlled online.

**Key Features:**
- **Discovery:** Helps find sensors, processes, and their data.
- **Tasking:** Allows controlling sensors and requesting specific data.
- **Access:** Provides ways to get sensor readings and streams of data.
- **Alerts:** Supports sending alerts when certain conditions are met.

**Standards Provided:**
- **Sensor Observation Service (SOS):** Access sensor data over the web.
- **Sensor Planning Service (SPS):** Control sensors and request data.
- **Sensor Alert Service (SAS):** Get alerts from sensors.
- **Web Notification Service:** Sends notifications about sensor data changes.

### 2. Ubiquitous Sensor Networks (USN)

**What is it?**
USN is a framework that uses existing networks to gather data from sensors and provide useful services based on that data. It's like a network that connects and manages sensors to give us information we need.

**Components:**
- **USN Applications Platform:** Framework to use USN in different applications.
- **USN Middleware:** Software that manages sensor networks, processes data, and connects everything.
- **Network Infrastructure:** Uses existing networks (like internet or mobile networks) to transmit sensor data.
- **USN Gateway:** Connects sensor networks with other types of networks.
- **Sensor Network:** Network of connected sensors, which can be directly connected or through gateways.

**Purpose:**
USN helps make sense of data collected by sensors in real-world environments, enabling applications like environmental monitoring, smart cities, and more efficient industrial processes.



# M2M Standards

The standards and architecture frameworks for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, as outlined by various organizations and initiatives such as ETSI(European Telecommunications Standards Institute) and OMA(Open Mobile Alliance), focus on ensuring interoperability and enabling seamless automated data exchange between machines. Here's a structured format summarizing the key elements and standards in M2M:

### Key Elements of M2M Architecture:

_The examples also imply the standards/protocols they need to follow_

1. **M2M Device**:
