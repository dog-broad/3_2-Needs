# Classification of Performance Characteristics

Performance characteristics are the key properties of an instrument that matter when evaluating its performance. For example, the precision of a measuring instrument, the speed of a computer, or the accuracy of a medical diagnostic device.

There are two basic types of performance characteristics:

**1. Static characteristics:** These are the performance characteristics that do not change over time or with use.
**2. Dynamic characteristics:** These are the performance characteristics that change over time or with use.

### Static Characteristics

* The static characteristics of an instrument are, in general, considered for instruments which are used to measure an unvarying process condition
* In simple terms, static characteristics are the characteristics that do not change over time or with use.
* All the static performance characteristics are obtained by one form or another of a process called calibration.

There are a number of related static performance characteristics. Some of the most important ones include:

1. **Instrument:** A device or mechanism used to determine the present value of the quantity being measured.

2. **Measurement:** The process of determining the amount, degree, or capacity of something by comparison(direct or indirect) with another accepted standards of the system being used.

3. **Accuracy:** The degree to which the measurement is correct. It is the closeness of the agreement between the result of a measurement and the true value of the quantity being measured.

$$
\text{Accuracy(A)} = 1 - \left| \frac{Y_n - X_n}{Y_n} \right|
$$

4. **Resolution**: The smallest change in a measured variable to which an instrument will respond.

5. **Precision**: The consistency or repeatability of measurements, meaning successive readings do not differ.

    The mathematical expression provided is:
$$ P = 1 - \left| \frac{X_n - \overline{X_n}}{X_n} \right| $$


6. **Expected Value**: The design value i.e. the most probable value that calculations indicate one should expect to measure.

7. **Errors:** The difference between the actual value and the expected value.

8. **Sensitivity:** The ratio of the change in the output(response) of the instrument to a change of input or emasured variable

### Dynamic Characteristics

- Instruments rarely respond instantaneously to changes in the measured variables. Instead, they exhibit slowness and sluggishness due to factors like mass, thermal capacitance, fluid capacitance, electric capacitance, and polarization, which cause a delay in reaction.
  
- The dynamic behavior of an instrument is determined by subjecting its primary element (sensing element) to unknown and predetermined variations in the measured quantity.

- The three most common variation in the measured quantity are:

    1. **Step Changes**, in which the primary element is subjected to an instantaneous and finite change in measured variable.
   
    2. **Linear Change**, in which the primary element is following a measured variable, changing linearly with time.
   
    3. **Sinusoidal Change**, in which the primary element follows a measured variable, the magnitude of which changes in accordance with a sinusoidal function of constant amplitude.

- The dynamic characteristics of an instrument are:
    
    1. **Speed of Response**: The rate at which the instrument responds to changes in the measured variable.
    2. **Fidelity**: The degree to which the instrument is able to accurately measure the measured variable.
    3. **Lag**: The time delay between the actual change in the measured variable and its indication by the instrument.
    4. **Dynamic Error**: The difference between the actual value of the measured variable and the value indicated by the instrument.
