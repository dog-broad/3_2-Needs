# Component of a Blockchain

Blockchain is a constantly growing **ledger** that keeps a **permanent** record of all the transactions that have taken place in a **secure**, **chronological**, and **immutable** way.

**Node:** Nodes are network participants whose devices allow them to track the distributed ledger and serve as communication hubs for various network tasks. When a miner attempts to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain, the block broadcasts to all network nodes.

**Transactions:** A transaction involves the transfer of assets between parties, typically cash or property. In blockchain, the network of computers stores transactional data as copies, with this storage referred to as a digital ledger. It is irreversible.

**Block:** A block in a blockchain network is akin to a link in a chain. In cryptocurrency, blocks resemble records storing transactions like entries in a record book, encrypted into a hash tree. Numerous transactions occur daily worldwide, necessitating user tracking facilitated by the block structure. It is important for the users to keep track of those transactions, and they do it with the help of a block structure.

**Chain:** The concept where all blocks are interconnected forms the chain structure of the blockchain worldwide. Each block is linked with the previous block's hash, establishing a chaining structure.

**Miners:** Participants in blockchain mining validate each transaction step across all cryptocurrencies. Known as miners, they ensure transaction integrity through cryptographic verification.

**Consensus:** A fault-tolerant mechanism crucial in blockchain and computer systems. It achieves agreement on the network's state among distributed processes or multi-agent systems, essential for operations like cryptocurrency record-keeping.
